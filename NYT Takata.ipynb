    "This story, done by The New York Times, investigates the content in complaints made to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) by customers who had bad experiences with Takata airbags in their cars. Eventually, car companies had to recall airbags made by the airbag supplier that promised a cheaper alternative. \n",

We're going to read a subset, mark each one as \"suspicious\" or \"not suspicious,\" then use that information to train the computer to read the rest and recognize which comments are suspicious and which are not suspicious.\n",

    "150 non-suspicious and 15 suspicious is a pretty terrible ratio, but we're remarkably lazy and not very many of the comments are actually suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've read a few, let's train our classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating features\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working on machine learning, you need to feed the algorithm a bunch of inputs so it can make its decision. These are called **features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a problem: computers only like features to be numbers, but every complaint is **just a bunch of text**, a.k.a. \"unstructured data.\" How can we turn all of this unstructured data into something a computer can understand?\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are fancier (and more effective!) ways to do what we're about to do, the simple start below is going to provide a foundation for later work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To teach our computer how to find suspicious complaints, we first need to think about how we find those complaints as human beings. By reading, right? So let's teach the computer how to read, and what to look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing our features\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what the airbag issue is, according [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/takata-airbag-recall-everything-you-need-to-know/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Vehicles made by 19 different automakers have been recalled to replace frontal airbags on the driver’s side or passenger’s side, or both in what NHTSA has called \"the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. history.\" The airbags, made by major parts supplier Takata, were mostly installed in cars from model year 2002 through 2015. Some of those airbags could deploy explosively, injuring or even killing car occupants. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> At the heart of the problem is the airbag’s inflator, a metal cartridge loaded with propellant wafers, which in some cases has ignited with explosive force. If the inflator housing ruptures in a crash, metal shards from the airbag can be sprayed throughout the passenger cabin—a potentially disastrous outcome from a supposedly life-saving device.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're going through a list of vehicle complaints, it isn't too hard for us to figure out which complaints we might want to investigate further. If the complaint's about seatbelts or rear-view mirrors, we probably don't care about it. If the word \"airbag\" shows up in the description, though, we're going to start paying attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aren't interested in all complaints with the word \"airbag,\" though. Since we're worried about exploding airbags, something like \"the airbag did not deploy\" would get our attention because of the word \"airbag,\" but then we could ignore it once we saw the airbag just didn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting our features\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we just read a long long list of airbag complaints, we can probably brainstorm some words or phrases that might make a comment interesting or not interesting. A quick start might be these few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* airbag\n",
    "* air bag\n",
    "* failed\n",
    "* did not deploy\n",
    "* violent\n",
    "* explode\n",
    "* shrapnel\n",
    "\n",
    "These **features** are the things that the machine learning algorithm is going to look for when it's reading. There are lots of words in each complaint, but these are the only ones we'll tell the classifier to pay attention to!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building our features dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to convert each sentence into a list of numbers. It will be a new dataframe, where there's a `1` if the word is in the complaint and a `0` if it isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if a word is in `CDESCR`, we can use `.str.contains`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**See if each row has the word `AIRBAG` in it.**"
